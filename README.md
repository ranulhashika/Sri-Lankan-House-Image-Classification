# House Image Classification for Sri Lankan Homes üè†üñºÔ∏è

## Project Overview üåç
This project classifies Sri Lankan house images into four categories:
- **Pantry**
- **Bathroom**
- **Indoor**
- **Outdoor**

The objective of this model is to integrate with classified advertisement platforms to enhance their performance. It achieves an accuracy of **80%**.
